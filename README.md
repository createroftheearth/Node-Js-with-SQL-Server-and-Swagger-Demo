# Node-Js-with-SQL-Server-and-Swagger-Demo

Node Js with SQL Server and Swagger Demo just change files and queries in files and you are good to go 

## Getting Started

Clone the repository then open your bash and type
 ```
 npm install
 ```
 
This allows your system to install all packages available in packages.json and then Change your SQL Server settings in .env file.

I have created a basic GET request on
```
\api\events
```
and you will find swagger documentation in 

```
\documentation
```
